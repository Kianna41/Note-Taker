## Expected Outcome

1. When user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column.
2. When the user enters a new note title and note's text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
3. When the user clicks the Save icon, a new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
4. When the user click on an existing note in the list on the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.
5. When the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, an empty field appears to enter a new note title and note text on the right-hand column.
